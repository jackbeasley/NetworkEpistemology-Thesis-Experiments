This thesis would not have been possible without the countless
conversations, suggestions, feedback, and encouragement of my advisors
Prof.~Helen Longino and Prof.~Thomas Icard.

I started working on this project over a year ago now as a project
studying retractions in science, which led me head-on into an empirical
social science project and away from the interdisciplinary mix of
philosophy and computer science that I wanted to work on. Prof.~Longino
helped introduce me to computational philosophy through the work of
Kevin Zollman, which eventually led to this thesis. Once on that topic,
the many conversations I had with both Prof.~Longino and Prof.~Icard
brought me different perspectives and viewpoints that not only shaped my
views expressed in this thesis but helped me start to understand what
philosophy research is about in the first place.

I must also thank both the philosophy and computer science departments
who provided me great preparation through some fantastic coursework over
the years. I give special thanks to Jure Leskovec's CS 224W network
analysis where I learned many of the graph analysis techniques used in
this thesis.
